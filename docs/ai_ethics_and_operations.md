## TL;DR (The 30-Second Version)

AI is a tool, not a teammate. Humans stay accountable. Transparency beats magic. Data requires consent. Bias exists—plan for it. Document everything. Don't let models make decisions they can't explain. Review regularly. Unicorns are allowed; just keep them away from production.

## What This Is (And Isn't)

This isn't a manifesto. It's not a shield against liability. It's the operating system for how I use AI at Sugartown and out IRL—and if you're here reading this, probably how you should think about it too.

We use AI. A lot. Claude drafts. Python scripts publish. Diagrams generate themselves. But the *thinking* stays human, and the *accountability* stays mine.

Here's how that works.

### What This Page Isn't

- **A legal shield** (talk to a lawyer)
- **A substitute for critical thinking** (you still have to use your brain)
- **A promise that we're perfect** (we are not)
- **Permission to be reckless if you follow the rules** (rules ≠ ethics autopilot)

## The Operating Principles

### 1. Humans Stay Accountable

AI can suggest, draft, summarize, remix, and hallucinate politely. Humans own decisions, outcomes, and apologies. If something ships, publishes, or impacts a person, a human signs for it.

**In practice:** Every published node has a human author. Every deployment has a human who clicked "merge." Every user-facing decision traces back to a name, not a model version.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 2. Purpose Before Power

Use AI because it reduces toil, improves clarity, or unlocks creativity—not because it's shiny. If the AI output doesn't make work better, faster, or more humane, put the unicorn out to pasture.

**In practice:** If you're using AI to solve a problem that `grep` handles in 3 seconds, you're cosplaying innovation.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 3. Transparency Beats Magic

People should know when AI is involved, at least at a conceptual level. You don't need a blinking "AI DID THIS" banner—just no deceptive automation cosplay.

**In practice:** If AI writes a draft, we say "drafted with AI, edited by human." If AI generates an image, alt text says so. No sock puppets.

---

### 4. Data Is Not a Free Buffet

Only use data you:
- Are allowed to use
- Understand the provenance of
- Would feel okay explaining out loud to a lawyer, user, journalist, or your dad

If you wouldn't paste it into a public doc, don't feed it to a model.

**Consent matters.** If someone didn't agree to have their data used for training, inference, or fine-tuning, you don't get to treat it like public domain just because it's *technically* accessible.

**In practice:** Client work stays in client contexts. Personal data never trains models. Scraped content gets side-eyed before use.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 5. Bias Exists. Plan Accordingly.

AI reflects the internet, history, and power structures—none of which are neutral. Assume bias is present. Design review, testing, and escalation paths before harm shows up in production.

**In practice:** Test outputs with diverse inputs. Challenge assumptions. If a model's answer feels *off*, trust your instincts and dig deeper.

---

### 6. Augment, Don't Replace Judgment

AI is great at:
- Pattern detection
- Drafting
- Summarizing
- Exploring possibilities

AI is bad at:
- Moral reasoning
- Contextual nuance
- Accountability
- Formatting output according to spec

Treat it like a very fast intern with perfect recall, zero lived experience, and a tendency to confuse "sounds right" with "is right."

**In practice:** AI can draft the spec. Humans decide if it ships. AI can suggest copy. Humans verify it's not confidently wrong.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 7. Fail Softly

Design systems so AI mistakes are:
- Reversible
- Inspectable
- Non-catastrophic

No silent automation cliffs. No "oops, the model decided" moments.

**In practice:** Every automated publish has a rollback mechanism. Every AI-generated output has a human checkpoint. Logs capture everything.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 8. Governance Is a Feature

Logs, versioning, audits, prompts-as-artifacts, and clear ownership are not bureaucracy. They are how you prove you're not running a chaos engine with vibes.

**Prompts are documentation.** Versioning is a safety rail. If you can't explain *why* the AI did something, you don't understand your own system.

**In practice:** Prompts live in version control. API calls log to structured storage. Every node has a creation timestamp and authorship trail.

---

### 9. Creative Play Is Allowed

Yes, you may:
- Brainstorm with AI
- Use metaphors
- Generate unicorns, diagrams, thought experiments, and hilarious self-portraits

Just don't confuse play with truth or fiction with policy.

**In practice:** AI-generated mockups, diagrams, and concept art? Great. AI-generated legal advice, financial projections, or hiring decisions? Absolutely not.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 10. Revisit Regularly

Responsible AI is not a checkbox. Models change. Context changes. Stakes change. Review assumptions like you review dependencies.

**In practice:** This page gets reviewed every 6 months. Principles update when failures teach us something. The changelog is public.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 11. Attribution Matters

If AI helps write, design, or code something, that's collaboration—not plagiarism, not magic. Credit your tools like you'd credit a co-author. If a model trained on scraped data produces something suspiciously specific, verify provenance. Generators aren't citation engines.

**In practice:** Claude gets credit in project docs. AI-generated images cite the model. If something feels too polished to be original, we verify sources before publishing.

[↑ Back to top](#ai-ethics--operations-aka-how-not-to-build-skynet)

---

### 12. Compute Has a Carbon Cost

Every API call burns electricity. Every training run has a footprint. Use AI where it creates value, not where it's a lazy substitute for a search query or a bash script. Efficiency is an ethics problem, not just an ops problem.

**In practice:** Use cached results when possible. Don't regenerate content unnecessarily. Batch API calls. Choose smaller models when they suffice.

## When Things Go Wrong (Not If)

AI will fail. Models will hallucinate. Bias will surface. When that happens:

1. **Stop the system** – Pull it offline if harm is occurring
2. **Document the failure** – Logs, inputs, outputs, context
3. **Communicate transparently** – Tell affected people what happened
4. **Fix the root cause** – Not just the symptom
5. **Update this page** – Your ethics are only as good as your learning loop

**Escalation path:** Issues go to [contact bex](https://sugartown.io/contact/). Critical failures pause all automated systems until root cause analysis completes.

## Accessibility Commitment

### AI Must Not Break Accessibility

If AI generates content, it must:
- Provide alt text for images
- Use semantic HTML
- Work with screen readers
- Not rely on visual-only cues
- Generate WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant output

**If a model outputs inaccessible garbage, that's a bug, not a feature.**

**In practice:** AI-generated images include descriptive alt text. Code snippets include ARIA labels. Content follows semantic heading hierarchy. Automated checks run before publish.

## The Quiet Truth Beneath the Cheeky Attitude

Responsible AI isn't about neutering creativity or slowing teams down. It's about making AI *boring in the ways that matter*, so it can be powerful where it helps.

You can have unicorns. You can brainstorm with models, generate absurd diagrams, and let Claude write your first draft.

Just don't let them run payroll, justice, hiring decisions, or prod deploys unsupervised.

And if something breaks? A human apologizes. Not a model.
