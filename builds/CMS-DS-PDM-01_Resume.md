## Professional Summary
Product manager specializing in headless CMS, enterprise design systems, and structured content architecture for global, multi-brand ecosystems. I bridge UX, engineering, and content to build platforms where teams can design, ship, and evolve digital products with clarity and speed. My work centers on composable systems, multi-surface content delivery, and Al-supported workflows, helping organizations scale with reusable components, flexible schema design, and opinionated tooling. I thrive in ambiguous, systems-heavy environments where shaping foundational capabilities unlocks creativity across the entire product organization.
